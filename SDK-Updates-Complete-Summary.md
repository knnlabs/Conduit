# SDK Updates Complete Summary

## Overview
Successfully applied the same fixes to both the .NET and Node.js SDKs to address non-existent API endpoints and add missing functionality.

## Changes Applied

### 1. ✅ Video Generation - Fixed Non-existent Synchronous Endpoint
**Both SDKs**:
- Removed synchronous video generation methods that called non-existent `/v1/videos/generations` endpoint
- Updated documentation to clarify that only async video generation is supported
- Fixed video task status endpoint path to include `/tasks/`

### 2. ✅ Health Endpoints - Fixed Authentication and Paths
**Both SDKs**:
- Changed from authenticated `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints to unauthenticated `/health` endpoint
- Created separate HTTP clients without authentication headers for health checks
- Added documentation explaining that health checks are at root level without `/v1` prefix

### 3. ✅ Batch Operations - Updated Documentation
**Both SDKs**:
- Removed references to non-existent generic `/v1/batch` endpoint
- Documented specific batch endpoints:
  - `/v1/batch/spend-updates`
  - `/v1/batch/virtual-key-updates`
  - `/v1/batch/webhook-sends`
  - `/v1/batch/operations/{id}` for status checks

### 4. ✅ Embeddings Support - Added Complete Implementation
**Both SDKs**:
- Created comprehensive embeddings models and services
- Added support for all OpenAI embedding models
- Implemented cosine similarity calculations
- Added helper methods for finding similar texts
- Support for both float and base64 encoding formats

### 5. ❌ Image Edit/Variations - Documented as Not Implemented
**Both SDKs**:
- Added comments noting that `/v1/images/edits` and `/v1/images/variations` endpoints are not implemented in Core API
- These methods remain in the SDKs but are documented as non-functional

## Build Status
- **.NET SDK**: ✅ Builds successfully with no errors or warnings
- **Node.js SDK**: ✅ Builds successfully with TypeScript compilation

## Key Features Added

### Embeddings Functionality
Both SDKs now include:
- Single text embedding creation
- Batch text embedding creation
- Cosine similarity calculation between vectors
- Find most similar texts from a list of candidates
- Support for dimension reduction (text-embedding-3 models)
- Proper error handling and validation

### Health Check Improvements
- Correct endpoint usage without authentication
- Proper fallback error responses
- Support for component-specific health checks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Video Generation**:
   - Test async video generation with polling
   - Verify task status checks work correctly

2. **Health Checks**:
   - Verify health endpoints work without API key
   - Test all health check methods return expected data

3. **Embeddings**:
   - Test with different embedding models
   - Verify similarity calculations are accurate
   - Test batch processing with multiple texts

4. **Batch Operations**:
   - Test each specific batch endpoint
   - Verify operation status polling works correctly

## Migration Guide for SDK Users

### .NET SDK Users
```csharp
// Old (broken):
var video = await client.Videos.GenerateAsync(request);

// New (working):
var taskResponse = await client.Videos.GenerateAsync(request);
var video = await client.Videos.PollTaskUntilCompletionAsync(taskResponse.TaskId);
```

### Node.js SDK Users
```typescript
// Old (broken):
const video = await client.videos.generate(request);

// New (working):
const taskResponse = await client.videos.generateAsync(request);
const video = await client.videos.pollTaskUntilCompletion(taskResponse.taskId);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Publish Updated SDKs**:
   - Update version numbers in both SDKs
   - Publish to NuGet (.NET) and npm (Node.js)
   - Update documentation with migration guide

2. **Consider Core API Updates**:
   - Implement image edit/variations endpoints if needed
   - Or remove these methods from SDKs entirely

3. **Add Integration Tests**:
   - Create test suites that verify all endpoints work correctly
   - Add examples demonstrating proper usage of fixed methods
