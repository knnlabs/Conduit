## Timeline

The Admin API migration is on track according to the timeline outlined in the Legacy Mode Deprecation Timeline:

- **May 2025**: ‚úÖ Added deprecation warnings
- **June 2025**: ‚úÖ Published migration guides
- **July 2025**: üîÑ Adding more visible warnings
- **August 2025**: ‚è≥ Feature freeze for legacy mode scheduled
- **September 2025**: ‚è≥ Implementation of removal changes scheduled
- **October 2025**: ‚è≥ Final removal scheduled

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on:

1. Completing the remaining adapter unit tests
2. Creating E2E tests for Admin API mode
3. Optimizing AdminApiClient performance

## Conclusion

The Admin API migration is progressing well, with most foundational work completed. The system now defaults to using the Admin API, and comprehensive documentation has been created to help users migrate to the new architecture.

The migration is on track to complete the full removal of legacy mode by the scheduled date in October 2025.
