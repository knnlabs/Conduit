# Provider Error Tracking - Technical Debt and Risk Register

**Date Created**: 2025-01-25  
**Feature**: Automatic Provider Error Tracking and Disabling  
**Status**: Implemented but requires hardening for production  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - System can permanently disable all providers without recovery

## Executive Summary

We implemented automatic error tracking that disables failing API keys and providers. While functional, the system lacks critical recovery mechanisms and could lead to permanent service degradation without manual intervention.

## Critical Risks Requiring Decision

### 1. Permanent Provider Disabling (HIGH RISK)
**Current Behavior**: When a provider's primary key fails (e.g., 401 error), the entire provider is permanently disabled.

**Risk**: 
- Temporary API outages become permanent system failures
- Renewed/fixed API keys don't automatically re-enable providers
- All providers could eventually become disabled

**Research Needed**:
- Should we implement automatic recovery with exponential backoff?
- What conditions should trigger re-enabling (time-based, manual, health check)?
- How do we prevent thundering herd when re-enabling?

**Decision Required**: Recovery strategy and implementation approach

### 2. No Circuit Breaker Pattern (HIGH RISK)
**Current Behavior**: Binary on/off state for providers with no middle ground.

**Risk**:
- No gradual degradation
- No partial traffic routing during recovery
- Immediate full traffic on re-enable could cause cascading failures

**Research Needed**:
- Use Polly for circuit breakers or build custom?
- What thresholds trigger circuit states (failure %, count)?
- How to integrate with existing error tracking?

**Decision Required**: Circuit breaker library selection and integration strategy

### 3. Silent Error Tracking Failures (MEDIUM RISK)
**Current Behavior**: If Redis is down, error tracking fails silently.

```csharp
catch (Exception trackingEx)
{
    _logger?.LogError(trackingEx, "Failed to track provider error");
    // Continues without tracking - no fallback
}
```

**Risk**:
- Lost visibility during infrastructure issues
- No fallback storage mechanism
- Could miss critical error patterns

**Research Needed**:
- Implement local file fallback?
- Queue errors for later processing?
- Add health check endpoint for error tracking system?

**Decision Required**: Fallback strategy when Redis unavailable

## Technical Debt Items

### 1. Complex Streaming Exception Handling
**Current Implementation**: Manual async enumerator iteration to catch streaming exceptions.

**Impact**: 
- Increased code complexity
- Higher maintenance burden
- Potential for bugs in error handling

**Refactoring Options**:
- Extract to reusable utility method
- Consider middleware approach
- Document pattern for team understanding

### 2. Incomplete Exception Information
**Location**: `ExceptionHandler.cs`

**Issue**: Some code paths create `LLMCommunicationException` without preserving `StatusCode`.

**Impact**: Errors may not be properly classified and tracked.

**Fix Required**: Audit all exception creation paths and ensure StatusCode preservation.

### 3. Race Condition in Provider Disabling
**Current Code**:
```csharp
if (provider != null && provider.IsEnabled)
{
    provider.IsEnabled = false;  // Not atomic
    await providerRepo.UpdateAsync(provider);
}
```

**Impact**: Concurrent requests could cause duplicate operations or inconsistent state.

**Solutions to Evaluate**:
- Distributed locking (Redis-based)
- Database-level optimistic concurrency
- Idempotent update operations

## Missing Observability

### Metrics Needed
- Error rate by provider/key
- Provider disable/enable events
- Time since last successful request per provider
- Circuit breaker state transitions

### Alerts Needed
- Provider automatically disabled
- All providers disabled (service down)
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- No successful requests in X minutes

### Dashboards Needed
- Real-time provider health status
- Historical error patterns
- Recovery success rates
- API key utilization and rotation

## Performance Considerations

### Measured Impact
- Decorator adds ~1-5ms latency per request
- Exception processing on errors only
- Redis operations are async/non-blocking

### Optimization Opportunities
- Batch Redis operations
- Cache provider status locally with TTL
- Async fire-and-forget for non-critical tracking

## Proposed Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Safety Features (1-2 weeks)
1. Add provider recovery service with health checks
2. Implement basic circuit breaker
3. Add monitoring/alerts for provider status

### Phase 2: Production Hardening (2-3 weeks)
1. Distributed locking for state changes
2. Transaction boundaries for data consistency
3. Comprehensive observability dashboard

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)
1. Intelligent recovery strategies (ML-based?)
2. Predictive failure detection
3. Automatic key rotation support

## Research Questions

1. **Recovery Strategy**: How do other API gateway products handle provider failures?
2. **Industry Standards**: What are best practices for API key rotation and failover?
3. **User Experience**: Should we notify users when providers are auto-disabled?
4. **Cost Implications**: How does aggressive retry impact API costs?
5. **Legal/Compliance**: Are there requirements for error logging retention?

## Next Steps

1. **Team Discussion**: Review risks and prioritize fixes
2. **Spike Research**: Investigate circuit breaker libraries
3. **Design Doc**: Create detailed recovery service design
4. **Security Review**: Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive data
5. **Load Testing**: Validate behavior under high error rates
