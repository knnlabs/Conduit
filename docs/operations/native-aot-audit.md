# NativeAOT audit and CI baselines

Gateway runtime feature support, exclusions, process gates, and the third-party risk ledger are defined in [gateway-native-aot-feature-matrix.md](gateway-native-aot-feature-matrix.md). A successful publish alone is not a claim that the full JIT data plane is supported.

NativeAOT readiness is measured separately from the normal JIT developer loop. The
production services remain framework-dependent until the persistence and runtime
parity phases are complete.

## Local analyzer audit

From the repository root, run:

```powershell
./scripts/aot/aot-audit.ps1
```

This is the single local audit command. It rebuilds the Admin and Gateway service
graphs with `ConduitAotAudit=true`, enabling AOT and trim analyzers, reflection-disabled
JSON defaults, generated configuration binding, and generated request delegates. It
does not set `PublishAot` or run the native linker.

Results are written to `artifacts/aot-audit/`:

- `diagnostics.json` contains every unique first-party warning with its code,
  project, source file, line, column, and message.
- `summary.md` reports counts by warning code and project.
- `admin.log` and `gateway.log` retain the raw build output.

The checked-in `scripts/aot/warning-baseline.json` is a ratchet grouped by project,
warning code, and source file. Counts may decrease without changing the baseline;
new groups or increased counts fail. After deliberately reviewing a changed warning
inventory, regenerate it with:

```powershell
./scripts/aot/aot-audit.ps1 -UpdateBaseline
```

Do not update the baseline to hide a regression. The later NativeAOT phases should
normally only reduce it.

## Current ratchet

The 2026-08-12 post-phase audit contains **264** unique first-party diagnostics,
down from 509 before the epic-level cleanups. The first cleanup removed all 139
`MaxLengthAttribute` `IL2026` diagnostics by using statically analyzable string
validation and an explicit collection-count validator. The next cleanup removed 12
paired `IL2026`/`IL3050` diagnostics from the closed pricing-configuration shapes by
adding source-generated JSON metadata. The Bedrock Converse cleanup removed another
10 paired diagnostics by replacing dynamic JSON conversion with typed content handling
and generated metadata. The OpenAI-compatible mapping cleanup removed 10 more by using
typed tool-call contracts, generated annotation metadata, and explicit content-array
handling. The media-cleanup cache cleanup removed another eight paired diagnostics
with a dedicated source-generated Redis context. Regression tests preserve validation,
provider-wire behavior, and legacy cache contracts. Model-capability persistence then
removed eight more with generated configuration metadata while retaining legacy reads.
The async-task boundary cleanup removed another 22 paired diagnostics by generating
the persisted metadata/cache contracts and replacing anonymous result payloads with
statically described models or JSON DOM values. It also makes progress updates work
against the `JsonElement` values produced when persisted results are read back.
The shared security-cache cleanup removed another eight paired diagnostics by passing
generated contracts through its generic cache helpers and deleting an unused dynamic
value helper.
The multimodal content-helper cleanup removed another eight paired diagnostics by
limiting its supported shapes to strings, JSON elements, typed content parts, and
enumerables instead of reflectively serializing arbitrary objects to inspect them.
The Vertex service-account cleanup removed another eight paired diagnostics with a
generated credential/token/JWT contract, including explicit metadata for polymorphic
JWT string and integer claim values.
The shared Redis-cache cleanup removed another six paired diagnostics by requiring
source-generated metadata at its generic read/write boundary and registering the
Gateway provider, tool, and parsed-pricing cache shapes.
The streaming cleanup removed another six paired diagnostics by requiring generated
metadata for generic SSE/custom-stream parsing and registering the OpenAI-compatible
and MiniMax stream contracts.

The remaining inventory is dominated by reflection-based generic JSON overloads.
Treat the generated `diagnostics.json` as the source of truth when selecting the next
coherent cleanup; do not infer warning counts from duplicated native-linker output.

## Native publish lane

`.github/workflows/native-aot.yml` publishes both services for `linux-x64` after
merges to `master`, on a weekly schedule, and on manual dispatch. The workflow:

1. Native-publishes both service projects without changing normal build properties.
2. Moves `.dbg`/`.pdb` files out of runtime directories into a symbols artifact.
3. Launches each native executable using the infrastructure-free OpenAPI entry path.
4. Retains publish time, executable and runtime size, OpenAPI readiness time, peak
   working set, generated OpenAPI documents, and process logs.

Native smoke results are measurements during the readiness epic. A known runtime
failure is visible in the report and job summary without discarding successful
publish artifacts. JIT build/test and Docker validation jobs are unchanged.
