# Billing correctness alerting

Conduit runs an internal cost canary for every enabled model mapping. The canary does not call a
provider or debit a virtual key; it sends synthetic positive usage through the same model-cost lookup
and calculation service used by request billing.

## Configuration

Set these environment variables on the Admin and Grafana services:

```text
BillingCostCanary__Enabled=true
BillingCostCanary__IntervalMinutes=5
# Optional: enables outbound Grafana notifications when set
CONDUIT_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-alert-receiver.example/conduit
```

`CONDUIT_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` is optional. Grafana always provisions and evaluates the supplied alert
rules. When the variable is set, Grafana also provisions the `conduit-oncall` webhook contact point
and notification policy. When it is unset or empty, outbound webhook notifications are disabled and
firing alerts remain visible in Grafana.

The supplied Grafana rule treats a canary older than 15 minutes as stale. If the interval is increased,
update the stale threshold in `grafana/provisioning/alerting/billing-alerting-rules.yml` as well.

## Alerts

- `Billing Revenue Loss Event` fires for any revenue-loss counter increase.
- `Unexpected Zero-Cost Billing` fires when a request is calculated at zero cost.
- `Model Cost Canary Failed` fires when an active mapping has no usable cost, invalid pricing JSON,
  an expired/inactive cost, a calculation error, or a non-positive result.
- `Model Cost Canary Stale` fires when the canary is absent or has not completed for 15 minutes.
- `Token Counting Degraded to Character Heuristic` fires when any token estimate falls back to the
  chars/4 heuristic (`conduit_token_count_estimates_total{fidelity="character_heuristic"}`). That
  only happens when tokenizer vocabulary data cannot be loaded, which means spend reservations and
  streaming-fallback billing are running on estimates that under-count by 20-40%. Larger safety
  buffers are applied automatically on this tier, but the underlying cause — look for
  `Failed to load encoding` in Gateway/Admin logs — should be fixed promptly.

## Token-count fidelity metric

`conduit_token_count_estimates_total{fidelity=...}` counts every token estimate by how it was
produced: `exact` (the model's own vocabulary), `approximate_vocabulary` (a documented tiktoken
stand-in, normal for non-OpenAI models), or `character_heuristic` (vocabulary unavailable — the
alarm condition above). The exact-to-approximate ratio is expected to reflect your provider mix;
`character_heuristic` is expected to be permanently zero.

## Response

1. Query `BillingAuditEvents` for `ModelCostCanaryFailed` and note the mapping ID, model-cost ID,
   pricing model, and normalized reason in `MetadataJson`.
2. Confirm that the mapping, provider, and provider-type association should remain enabled.
3. Restore a positive, active ModelCost whose effective/expiry dates cover the current time and whose
   pricing configuration passes validation.
4. Wait for the next canary run and confirm `conduit_billing_cost_canary_status` returns to `1` and the
   Grafana alert resolves.
5. For production revenue-loss events, reconcile affected request logs and ledger entries before
   closing the incident.

`conduit_billing_revenue_loss_dollars_total` currently counts revenue-loss events; despite its legacy
name, its value is not a dollar estimate.
