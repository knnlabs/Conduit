# Hovercard Component Render Mode Fix

## Issue
The Hovercard component wasn't working properly in the Blazor application. The component was rendering but the interactive features (mouseenter/mouseleave events) were not functioning.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to Blazor's render mode configuration. Components with interactive features (event handlers like `@onclick`, `@onmouseenter`, etc.) need to be explicitly configured with the `InteractiveServer` render mode in .NET 8+ Blazor applications.

## Solution
Added `@rendermode InteractiveServer` directive to the following components:

1. **Hovercard.razor** - The core component that handles hover interactions
2. **AdminApiHealthStatus.razor** - Parent component that uses Hovercard
3. **NotificationDisplay.razor** - Another component in MainLayout that needs interactivity
4. **App.razor** - Added render mode to the Router component for global coverage

## Code Changes

### 1. Hovercard.razor
```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components
@implements IDisposable
@rendermode InteractiveServer  // Added this line

<div class="hovercard-container" @onmouseenter="ShowHovercard" @onmouseleave="HideHovercard">
    ...
</div>
```

### 2. AdminApiHealthStatus.razor
```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components
@using ConduitLLM.WebUI.Interfaces
@using ConduitLLM.WebUI.Models
@using System.Threading
@implements IDisposable
@rendermode InteractiveServer  // Added this line

@inject IAdminApiHealthService HealthService
...
```

### 3. App.razor
```razor
<body>
    <CascadingAuthenticationState>
        <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly" @rendermode="InteractiveServer">  // Added render mode
            ...
        </Router>
    </CascadingAuthenticationState>
</body>
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test pages to verify the fix:

1. **HovercardTest.razor** - A dedicated test page at `/hovercard-test` that tests:
   - Different positions (top, bottom, left, right, bottom-start, bottom-end)
   - Different delay timings (0ms, 500ms, 1000ms)
   - Rich content with titles and complex HTML
   - Interactive content with state management
   - Simulation of the AdminApiHealthStatus component

2. **Updated TestInteractive.razor** - Added a simple Hovercard test to the existing interactive test page

## Key Learnings

1. **Render Mode Inheritance**: Child components don't automatically inherit render modes from parent components in Blazor
2. **Component Interactivity**: Any component using event handlers needs explicit render mode configuration
3. **Global vs Local Configuration**: While the app has `.AddInteractiveServerRenderMode()` in Program.cs, individual components still need the `@rendermode` directive
4. **CSS-Only Components**: Components like Tooltip that use only CSS for interactivity don't need render mode configuration

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. Navigate to `/hovercard-test` in the application
2. Hover over any of the test elements
3. Verify that hovercards appear after the specified delay
4. Check that hovercards disappear when mouse leaves
5. Test the counter in the interactive section maintains state
6. Verify the AdminApiHealthStatus icon in the top navigation shows its hovercard

## Future Considerations

1. Consider creating a base component class that automatically includes the render mode for interactive components
2. Document render mode requirements in component documentation
3. Add unit tests to verify interactive behavior
4. Consider using a global render mode strategy if most components need interactivity
