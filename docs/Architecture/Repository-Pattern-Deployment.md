# Repository Pattern Deployment Guide

This document outlines the recommended approach for deploying the repository pattern implementation to production environments.

## Overview

The migration from direct database access to the repository pattern is a significant architectural change. This guide recommends a gradual, controlled rollout to minimize risk.

## Prerequisites

- Successful testing in staging environment (see [Repository-Pattern-Testing.md](./Repository-Pattern-Testing.md))
- A deployment pipeline that supports feature flags
- Monitoring tools to track application performance and errors

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Ensure that all documentation reflects the new architecture
   - Document the deployment strategy for stakeholders

2. **Create Monitoring Dashboards**:
   - Set up dashboards to monitor key metrics:
     - API response times
     - Database query performance
     - Error rates
     - Memory usage

3. **Set Up Feature Flag**:
   - The `CONDUIT_USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN` environment variable acts as the feature flag
   - Ensure deployment pipelines can toggle this flag for specific environments

### Phase 2: Canary Deployment

1. **Select a Single Non-Critical Environment**:
   - Choose a production environment with lower traffic
   - Ensure it has its own database instance

2. **Deploy with Repository Pattern**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables for the canary deployment
   export CONDUIT_USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=true
   ```

3. **Monitor for 24-48 Hours**:
   - Watch for any errors or performance issues
   - Compare metrics with baseline from legacy implementation
   - Check logs for unexpected behavior

4. **Conduct Functional Validation**:
   - Test all key functionalities in the canary environment
   - Verify that APIs return expected results
   - Test database operations

### Phase 3: Progressive Rollout

1. **Define Rollout Stages**:
   - Group production environments into priority tiers
   - Create a schedule for progressive deployment

2. **Deploy to Tier 2 Environments**:
   - Apply the repository pattern to environments with moderate traffic
   - Monitor for 24 hours before proceeding

3. **Deploy to Tier 1 Environments**:
   - Apply the repository pattern to environments with high traffic
   - Increase monitoring frequency during the transition

4. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Maintain the ability to quickly revert to the legacy implementation
   - Prepare scripts to disable the repository pattern if needed:
     ```bash
     export CONDUIT_USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=false
     ```

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation

1. **Comprehensive System Testing**:
   - Test all API endpoints with the repository pattern enabled
   - Verify that all database operations function correctly
   - Run performance tests to compare with baseline

2. **Database Analysis**:
   - Monitor database performance under the new implementation
   - Check for any unexpected query patterns
   - Optimize if needed

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update all documentation to reflect the completed migration
   - Document any observed differences or benefits

## Phase 5: Legacy Code Removal

Once the repository pattern has been successfully deployed to all environments:

1. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove the legacy implementations
   - Remove the feature flag checks
   - Clean up any temporary code or wrappers

2. **Final Documentation**:
   - Document the completed migration
   - Provide guidelines for future repository-based development

## Monitoring and Metrics

Throughout the deployment process, monitor these key metrics:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - API response times
   - Database query execution times
   - Memory usage patterns
   - CPU utilization

2. **Error Metrics**:
   - Exception rates
   - HTTP error responses
   - Database connection issues

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - Virtual key operations
   - Request log recording
   - Cost calculation accuracy

## Rollback Process

If any critical issues are encountered during deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   - Set `CONDUIT_USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=false`
   - Restart the affected service
   - Verify that the system is functioning with the legacy implementation

2. **Incident Analysis**:
   - Collect logs and metrics from the failed deployment
   - Identify the root cause of the issue
   - Update the implementation to address the issue

3. **Re-test in Staging**:
   - Verify the fix in a staging environment
   - Run the comparison script to validate the changes
