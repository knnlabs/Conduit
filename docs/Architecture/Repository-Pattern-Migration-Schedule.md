## Detailed Plans by Phase

### Phase 1: Staging Testing

**Objective**: Validate the repository pattern implementation in a controlled environment.

**Tasks**:
- Execute test-repository-pattern.sh script
- Verify all functionality manually
- Run comparison tests between old and new implementations
- Resolve any issues found during testing

**Success Criteria**:
- All automated tests pass
- Manual validation confirms correct functionality
- Performance metrics meet or exceed baseline

### Phase 2: Canary Deployment

**Objective**: Deploy the repository pattern to a single production environment with lower traffic.

**Tasks**:
- Deploy to dev-prod environment with repository pattern enabled
- Monitor for 72 hours (including weekend and weekday traffic)
- Conduct functional validation tests
- Collect performance metrics

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical errors during 72-hour monitoring period
- API response times within 10% of baseline
- All functionality works correctly

### Phase 3: Tier 2 Deployment

**Objective**: Roll out to moderate-traffic environments.

**Tasks**:
- Deploy to EU region (3.1)
  - Update environment variables
  - Deploy application
  - Monitor for 24 hours
- Deploy to APAC region (3.2)
  - Update environment variables
  - Deploy application
  - Monitor for 24 hours

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical errors during deployment
- All key metrics within acceptable thresholds
- No user-reported issues

### Phase 4: Tier 1 Deployment

**Objective**: Complete rollout to high-traffic environments.

**Tasks**:
- Deploy to US East region (4.1)
  - Update environment variables
  - Deploy application
  - Enhanced monitoring for 24 hours
- Deploy to US West region (4.2)
  - Update environment variables
  - Deploy application
  - Enhanced monitoring for 24 hours

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical errors during deployment
- System performance within 5% of baseline
- No user-reported issues

### Phase 5: Legacy Code Removal

**Objective**: Clean up the codebase by removing legacy implementations.

**Tasks**:
- Create a branch for code cleanup
- Remove deprecated service implementations
- Remove implementation toggle code
- Update documentation to reflect final architecture
- Conduct final testing

**Success Criteria**:
- Codebase successfully builds and passes all tests
- No references to legacy implementations remain
- Documentation is fully updated

## Rollout Process for Each Environment

1. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - Notify stakeholders 24 hours before deployment
   - Review monitoring dashboards for baseline metrics
   - Prepare rollback script if needed

2. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Script to enable repository pattern in production
   export CONDUIT_USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=true
   
   # Deploy the application
   ./deploy.sh --environment=[environment_name]
   
   # Verify deployment
   ./health-check.sh --environment=[environment_name]
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Check logs for any errors
   - Run functional tests
   - Monitor key metrics for 15 minutes
   - If no issues, continue monitoring for the scheduled period

4. **Verification**:
   - Hourly checks during the first 4 hours
   - Check metrics after 24 hours to compare with baseline
   - Conduct database query analysis

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

For each environment, the migration will only proceed if:

1. **No Critical Errors**: No exceptions or errors that affect system functionality
2. **Performance Within Threshold**: Response times within 10% of baseline
3. **Database Performance Stable**: Query times and connection pool usage within normal ranges
4. **No Data Inconsistencies**: Data validation checks pass

## Communication Plan

| Milestone | Stakeholders | Communication Method | Timing |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| Deployment Start | Technical Team, Operations | Email, Slack | 24 hours before |
| Deployment Success | Technical Team, Operations | Slack | Immediately after |
| Monitoring Update | Technical Team | Slack | 1, 4, 24 hours after |
| Phase Completion | All Stakeholders | Email | After validation |
| Issues | Technical Team, Operations | Slack, Email | Immediately |

## Resources Required

1. **Personnel**:
   - 1 DevOps Engineer for each deployment
   - 1 Backend Developer for validation
   - 1 QA Engineer for testing

2. **Environments**:
   - Staging environment
   - Canary production environment
   - Regional production environments

3. **Tools**:
   - Deployment pipeline
   - Monitoring dashboards
   - Log aggregation system

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Database performance issues | Medium | High | Pre-test queries, have index tuning ready |
| API compatibility problems | Low | High | Comprehensive testing in staging |
| Increased error rates | Medium | Medium | Monitoring alerts, quick rollback plan |
| Memory leaks | Low | Medium | Extended monitoring in early phases |

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are encountered during deployment, follow this rollback procedure:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Set repository pattern to false
   export CONDUIT_USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=false
   
   # Redeploy the application
   ./deploy.sh --environment=[environment_name] --version=[last_stable_version]
   ```

2. **Verification**:
   - Verify that the system is functioning with legacy implementation
   - Run health checks to confirm system stability

3. **Post-Rollback**:
   - Notify stakeholders of the rollback
   - Analyze logs to identify the root cause
   - Create tickets for fixing the issues

## Sign-off Process

Before proceeding with each phase, obtain sign-off from:

1. Engineering Manager
2. Operations Manager
3. QA Lead

By following this detailed migration plan, we can safely transition all production environments to the repository pattern architecture while minimizing risk and disruption.
