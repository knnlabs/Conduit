# WebUI Controller Migration to Repository Pattern

This document outlines the approach taken to migrate WebUI controllers from direct database access to using the Repository Pattern.

## Migration Strategy

1. Create new service implementations using repositories rather than directly accessing DbContext
2. Create new controller implementations using the repository-based services
3. Register both old and new implementations to maintain backward compatibility
4. Update references and perform switchover as a separate phase

## Implemented Changes

The following services and controllers have been updated to use the Repository Pattern:

### VirtualKeyService

1. Created `VirtualKeyServiceNew` that uses:
   - `IVirtualKeyRepository`
   - `IVirtualKeySpendHistoryRepository`

2. Created `VirtualKeysController` that uses the new service.

3. The new service implementation handles:
   - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting virtual keys
   - Updating spend for virtual keys
   - Resetting budgets based on time periods
   - Validating virtual keys for use

### RequestLogService

1. Created `RequestLogServiceNew` that uses:
   - `IRequestLogRepository`
   - `IVirtualKeyRepository`

2. Created `LogsControllerNew` that uses the new service.

3. The new service implementation handles:
   - Creating and querying request logs
   - Generating usage summaries for virtual keys
   - Calculating statistics like total cost, tokens used, etc.
   - Maintaining cache for frequently requested data

## Benefits of Repository Pattern Implementation

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Data access logic is isolated in repositories, making services and controllers more focused on their primary responsibilities.

2. **Improved Testability**: Services can be tested with mocked repositories, allowing unit tests without database dependencies.

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes to data access patterns only require updates to repository implementations, not to all services.

4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Repositories encapsulate database errors and provide consistent error handling patterns.

5. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common data access operations are centralized in repositories.

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining controllers to use repository-based services:
   - CostDashboardController
   - AuthController
   - RouterController

2. Add unit tests for the new repository-based services

3. Switch routes to use the new controller implementations and deprecate the old ones

4. Monitor performance and fix any issues

## Implementation Notes

- Both old and new implementations are registered in DI to allow gradual migration
- Caching strategies have been maintained in the repository implementations
- Repository-based services maintain the same public interfaces as the original services
- Additional cancellation token support has been added throughout the repository implementation
