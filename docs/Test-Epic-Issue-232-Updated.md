## Test Quality Standards

### Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 90% line coverage, 80% branch coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered
- **Performance Tests**: Baseline established for all critical operations

### Test Patterns
1. **Behavior-Driven**: Test observable behavior, not implementation
2. **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of boundaries and errors
3. **Concurrency**: Thread-safety and race condition testing
4. **Performance**: Benchmarks for all performance-critical paths

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Testing mock invocations instead of behavior
- ❌ Using reflection to access internal types
- ❌ Tests without clear assertions
- ❌ Overly complex test setups
- ❌ Tests dependent on execution order

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Quality**
   - All tests follow behavior-driven approach
   - Mutation score > 80%
   - Zero flaky tests in CI/CD
   - All edge cases documented and tested

2. **Performance**
   - All unit tests complete in < 5 seconds
   - Integration tests complete in < 30 seconds
   - Performance benchmarks established

3. **Maintainability**
   - Test code duplication < 10%
   - Clear test naming conventions
   - Comprehensive test documentation
   - Reusable test infrastructure

## Timeline

- **Phase 2.5**: 2 weeks (High Priority)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks
- **Total**: 7-9 weeks to completion

## Dependencies

- BenchmarkDotNet for performance testing
- Stryker.NET for mutation testing
- Docker for integration test infrastructure
- Test containers for external dependencies

- #235: Contract Testing Implementation

## Notes

Based on the Phase 1 & 2 retrospective, we've identified several areas for improvement:
1. Some tests were verifying implementation details rather than behavior
2. Edge case coverage needs enhancement, particularly for Unicode and concurrency
3. Performance testing is completely missing
4. Integration testing framework needs to be established

The addition of Phase 2.5 addresses these concerns before proceeding with Phase 3.
