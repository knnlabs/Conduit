# Admin API Migration Status

This document outlines the status of the migration from direct database access to using the Admin API in the WebUI project.

## Migration Plan

The migration from direct database access to using the Admin API has been divided into multiple phases:

1. Phase 1: Implement required API endpoints and client methods for critical security features
2. Phase 2: Update configuration to default to using the Admin API
3. Phase 3: Final cleanup and dependency removal

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Security Features Implementation ✓

- Added new DTOs in Configuration project:
  - `ValidateVirtualKeyRequest`, `VirtualKeyValidationResult`, `UpdateSpendRequest`, `BudgetCheckResult`, `VirtualKeyValidationInfoDto`
  - `IpCheckResult` for IP filtering

- Extended Admin API interfaces and implementations:
  - Added validation, spend management, and budget checking methods to `IAdminVirtualKeyService`
  - Added high-performance IP validation method to `IAdminIpFilterService`

- Added API endpoints to controllers:
  - Added VirtualKey endpoints:
    - `POST /api/virtualkeys/validate`
    - `POST /api/virtualkeys/{id}/spend`
    - `POST /api/virtualkeys/{id}/check-budget`
    - `GET /api/virtualkeys/{id}/validation-info`
  - Added IP filter endpoint:
    - `GET /api/ipfilters/check/{ipAddress}`

- Updated WebUI client interfaces and implementations:
  - Added corresponding methods to `IAdminApiClient`
  - Implemented methods in partial class files `AdminApiClient.VirtualKeys.cs` and `AdminApiClient.IpFilters.cs`
  - Updated adapter implementations to use real API calls

### Phase 2: Configuration Update ✓

- Changed default configuration to use Admin API:
  - Updated `AdminApiOptions` to default `UseAdminApi = true`
  - Modified `AdminClientExtensions.AddAdminApiAdapters` to default to using Admin API
  - Made DbContext registration conditional based on `CONDUIT_USE_ADMIN_API` environment variable
  - Made repository service registration conditional based on direct database access setting
  - Added detailed logging to indicate which mode is being used

- Updated documentation:
  - Updated Environment-Variables.md to reflect the change in default behavior
  - Created this migration status document

### Phase 3: Final Cleanup and Dependency Removal ✓

- Made DatabaseSettingsStartupFilter compatible with Admin API mode
- Updated RouterExtensions.cs to make DbRouterConfigRepository conditional
- Enhanced VirtualKeyMaintenanceService to use either Admin API or direct access
- Added PerformMaintenanceAsync method to IVirtualKeyService interface
- Implemented maintenance methods in both VirtualKeyService and VirtualKeyServiceAdapter
- Added new Admin API endpoint for virtual key maintenance tasks
- Updated ProviderHealthMonitorService to use Admin API when available
- Marked all legacy service implementations as [Obsolete]
- Added comprehensive warnings in both UI and logs when using legacy mode
- Created feature flag to completely disable direct database access
- Updated documentation to reflect changes

## Implementation Complete

All three phases of the migration plan have been completed:

1. ✓ Phase 1: Implement required API endpoints for critical security features
2. ✓ Phase 2: Update configuration to default to using the Admin API 
3. ✓ Phase 3: Final cleanup and dependency removal

## Architecture Benefits

The migration to using the Admin API instead of direct database access brings several benefits:

1. **Improved Security**: Database credentials no longer needed in WebUI project
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: WebUI focuses on UI only, Admin API handles all data access
3. **Simplified Deployment**: WebUI can run without database access or dependencies
4. **Easier Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently
5. **Consistent API Surface**: All client applications use the same API with consistent validation

## Migration Timeline

✅ Phase 1 completed: May 2025  
✅ Phase 2 completed: May 2025  
✅ Phase 3 completed: May 2025  

The migration is now complete. Legacy mode is officially deprecated and will be removed according to the timeline in LEGACY-MODE-DEPRECATION-TIMELINE.md.

## Legacy Mode Support

For backward compatibility, legacy mode (direct database access) is still available by explicitly setting the `CONDUIT_USE_ADMIN_API` environment variable to `false`. This option will eventually be removed in future releases.
