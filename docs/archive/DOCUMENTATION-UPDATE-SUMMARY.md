- MIGRATION-COMPLETION-PLAN.md - Migration complete
- HARDCODED-MODELS-PROGRESS.md - Superseded by new status doc
- HARDCODED-MODELS-REMOVAL-PLAN.md - Superseded by new status doc
- RELEASE-NOTES-2025-11-0.md - Future release notes

## Documents Updated

### Architecture-Overview.md
- Added audio capabilities (transcription, TTS, real-time streaming)
- Added new subsystems: Audio Routing, Real-time Audio, Provider Health, Caching
- Updated component descriptions to include audio features
- Added audio request flow documentation
- Updated security architecture with audio permissions
- Noted that WebUI now uses Admin API exclusively

### Clean-Architecture-Guide.md
- Added audio interfaces to domain layer
- Added audio services to application layer
- Added audio implementations to infrastructure layer
- Added middleware layer as cross-cutting concerns
- Updated communication flows with audio and real-time patterns
- Added guide for implementing audio support in providers

### Repository-Pattern-Implementation.md
- Removed migration strategy references
- Updated to reflect repository pattern as standard
- Added audio repository documentation
- Updated implementation status to show completion
- Added best practices section

## Documents Created

### Audio-Architecture.md
Comprehensive documentation of the audio subsystem including:
- Core audio interfaces and components
- Provider implementations (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Ultravox)
- Audio routing architecture
- Real-time audio flow
- Usage tracking and cost calculation
- Security considerations

### Realtime-Architecture.md
Detailed documentation of WebSocket-based real-time audio:
- WebSocket proxy pattern
- Message translation architecture
- Connection lifecycle management
- Real-time usage tracking
- Security and limits
- Best practices for implementation

### Current-Status.md
High-level summary of Conduit's current state:
- Architecture overview
- Completed implementations
- Current limitations (hardcoded models)
- Technology stack
- Next steps and roadmap

### Hardcoded-Models-Status.md
Plan for removing remaining hardcoded models:
- Current status of hardcoded components
- Proposed database-driven solution
- Implementation plan with timeline
- Benefits and risk mitigation

## Key Findings

1. **Audio API is substantially complete** - Phases 1-6 are done, only advanced features remain
2. **Legacy mode has been fully removed** - WebUI uses Admin API exclusively
3. **Hardcoded models remain** - This is the main architectural debt to address
4. **Repository pattern is fully implemented** - All data access uses repositories

## Remaining Work

The following lower-priority documentation tasks were identified but not completed:
- Update Admin-API-Integration.md to focus on current state
- Create Middleware-Architecture.md for all middleware components
- Update DTO-Standardization.md to resolve known issues

These can be addressed in future documentation sprints as needed.
