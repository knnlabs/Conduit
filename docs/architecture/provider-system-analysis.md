# Provider System Architecture Analysis

## Context

While adding SambaNova as a new provider to Conduit, we discovered significant architectural complexity that makes provider integration more difficult than necessary. This document captures the issues encountered and explores potential improvements to the provider system architecture.

## The Problem: Adding SambaNova Required Changes in 10+ Files

### What We Had to Change

1. **Backend Enum Definition** - `ConduitLLM.Configuration/Enums/ProviderType.cs`
2. **Provider Client Implementation** - `ConduitLLM.Providers/Providers/SambaNova/SambaNovaClient.cs`
3. **Model Discovery** - `ConduitLLM.Providers/SambaNovaModels.cs`
4. **Factory Switch Statement** - `ConduitLLM.Providers/DatabaseAwareLLMClientFactory.cs`
5. **Admin Discovery Service** - `ConduitLLM.Admin/Services/ProviderModelDiscoveryService.cs` (2 places)
6. **Core Discovery Service** - `ConduitLLM.Core/Services/ProviderDiscoveryService.cs`
7. **TypeScript SDK Enum** - `SDKs/Node/Admin/src/models/providerType.ts`
8. **WebUI Provider Utilities** - `ConduitLLM.WebUI/src/lib/utils/providerTypeUtils.ts` (3 separate mappings)
9. **WebUI Constants** - `ConduitLLM.WebUI/src/lib/constants/providers.ts`
10. **Static Model JSON** - `ConduitLLM.Providers/StaticModels/sambanova-models.json`

### The Core Issues

#### 1. Multiple Discovery Service Implementations
We have three separate implementations of `IProviderModelDiscovery`:
- Each maintains its own list of "supported" providers
- Discovery logic is duplicated across implementations
- Changes must be synchronized manually

#### 2. Two-Level Support Checking
Discovery goes through multiple "does this provider support discovery?" checks:
- `ProviderDiscoveryService` checks if the provider type is in its supported list
- `ProviderModelDiscoveryService` has another supported types array
- Both needed to be updated independently

#### 3. Manual Type Synchronization
Provider types must be kept in sync across:
- C# enums
- TypeScript enums
- JavaScript object mappings
- Display name mappings

Each has slightly different formats and conventions.

#### 4. No Clear Extension Point
There's no single place where a provider "registers" itself. Instead, provider support is scattered across switch statements, type arrays, and mapping objects throughout the codebase.

## Current Architecture Patterns

### Provider Registration Flow
```
1. Define ProviderType enum value
2. Create client class (extends base or implements interface)
3. Add factory case for instantiation
4. Register in discovery services (multiple places)
5. Add TypeScript mappings (multiple places)
6. Configure UI display properties
```

### Discovery Flow
```
WebUI → Admin API → ProviderDiscoveryService → ProviderModelDiscoveryService → Provider-specific discovery
                                    ↓                          ↓
                          (checks supported list)    (checks another list)
```

## Potential Improvements to Consider

### Concept: Provider Manifests

Instead of scattered registration, providers could be self-describing:

- Single class/file that declares all provider capabilities
- Includes factory method for creating clients
- Includes discovery method
- Self-contained metadata (display name, aliases, base URL, etc.)

Benefits:
- One place to look for all provider information
- Easy to see what providers exist and their capabilities
- New providers just need to implement the manifest interface

### Concept: Unified Discovery Service

Rather than multiple discovery implementations:

- Single service that uses provider manifests
- No hardcoded lists of "supported" providers
- Support determined by manifest presence and capabilities

### Concept: Code Generation for Cross-Language Types

TypeScript types could be generated from C# types at build time:

- Single source of truth (C# enums and classes)
- Automatic synchronization
- Include metadata from provider manifests

### Concept: Plugin-Style Architecture

Providers could be more like plugins:

- Drop in a new provider assembly
- System automatically discovers it via reflection or registration
- No changes needed to core system files

## Questions for Further Discussion

1. **Migration Strategy**: How do we transition from current architecture without breaking existing functionality?

2. **Provider Variations**: Some providers (like OpenAI) have multiple implementations (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI Compatible). How should these be handled?

3. **Discovery Methods**: Some providers use API calls for discovery, others use static files, some might need both. How do we accommodate this flexibility?

4. **Configuration**: Where should provider-specific configuration live? In the manifest? In config files? In the database?

5. **Testing**: How do we test provider implementations without requiring actual API keys?

6. **Versioning**: How do we handle provider API versions and breaking changes?

## Lessons Learned

1. **Switch statements are a code smell** - When we see switch statements on type/enum, it often indicates missing polymorphism or a need for a registry pattern.

2. **Manual synchronization doesn't scale** - Keeping types synchronized across languages manually is error-prone and time-consuming.

3. **Discovery is a provider concern** - Each provider knows best how to discover its models. This should be encapsulated within the provider implementation.

4. **Duplication leads to drift** - Having multiple implementations of the same interface (like discovery services) leads to inconsistencies.

5. **Clear extension points matter** - The system should make it obvious where and how to add new functionality.

## Next Steps

This analysis is meant to start a conversation about improving the provider system architecture. The current system works but has accumulated complexity that makes it harder to maintain and extend than necessary.

Before implementing any changes, we should:
1. Agree on the problems that need solving
2. Prioritize which improvements would have the most impact
3. Design a migration path that doesn't disrupt existing functionality
4. Consider the trade-offs of any new architecture

The goal isn't to rewrite everything, but to identify targeted improvements that would make the system more maintainable and easier to extend with new providers.
