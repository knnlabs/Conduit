# SDK Integration Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to integrate the completed Admin SDK with the WebUI.

**Date**: January 11, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Type Augmentation File (`sdk-augmentation.d.ts`)
**Issue**: The type augmentation file was overriding the actual SDK types, causing TypeScript to not see the real methods.

**Fix**: Updated the file to be a placeholder that doesn't override any types, allowing the actual SDK types to be used.

### 2. Provider List Response Type
**Issue**: `adminClient.providers.list()` returns a `ProviderListResponseDto` object with an `items` property, not an array directly.

**Fix**: Updated code to access `providersResponse.items` instead of using the response directly.

### 3. Admin Client Configuration
**Issue**: The WebUI was using `adminApiUrl` property which doesn't exist in the SDK's `ApiClientConfig`.

**Fix**: Changed to use the correct `baseUrl` property and removed unnecessary `options.signalR` configuration.

### 4. Virtual Key Service Methods
**Issue**: The WebUI was using non-existent methods like `getById` and `deleteById`.

**Fix**: Changed to use the correct methods: `get` and `delete`, which expect string IDs.

### 5. Model Mapping Test Method
**Issue**: The `testCapability` method expects a numeric ID, not a string `modelId`.

**Fix**: Used the parsed ID from the route parameter instead of the model's string ID.

### 6. Missing Core SDK Services
**Issue**: The WebUI expected `images` and `videos` services in the Core SDK which don't exist.

**Fix**: Temporarily stubbed these endpoints to return 501 Not Implemented errors with TODO comments.

## Build Status

âœ… The WebUI now builds successfully with the completed Admin SDK!

## Next Steps

1. **Core SDK Enhancement**: Add image and video generation services to the Core SDK to support the stubbed endpoints.

2. **Remove Type Augmentation**: Once all SDK services are verified to be working correctly, the `sdk-augmentation.d.ts` file can be removed entirely.

3. **Test Integration**: Run the WebUI with the Admin API to ensure all endpoints work correctly with real data.

4. **Update Mock Data**: Several endpoints still use mock data generation. These should be updated to use real data from the Admin API once available.

## Files Modified

1. `/src/types/sdk-augmentation.d.ts` - Converted to placeholder
2. `/src/app/api/health/providers/route.ts` - Fixed provider list access
3. `/src/app/api/images/generate/route.ts` - Stubbed missing service
4. `/src/app/api/videos/generate/route.ts` - Stubbed missing service
5. `/src/app/api/model-mappings/[id]/test/route.ts` - Fixed test method call
6. `/src/app/api/virtualkeys/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed method names
7. `/src/lib/server/sdk-config.ts` - Fixed client configuration
8. `/src/lib/auth/validation.ts` - Fixed client configuration

## Warnings During Build

The build shows warnings about `CONDUIT_ADMIN_LOGIN_PASSWORD` not being set. This is expected in the build environment and the actual value should be set when running the application.
