# SDK Work Summary

## Overview

The Conduit Admin SDK (`@knn_labs/conduit-admin-client`) requires significant expansion to support all WebUI functionality. Currently, only 2 out of 10+ required services are implemented.

## Current State

### ✅ Implemented Services
1. **Virtual Keys Service** (`virtualKeys`)
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Validation and spending tracking
   
2. **Dashboard Service** (`dashboard`)
   - Metrics and analytics

### ❌ Missing Services (Required)
1. **Providers Service** - Provider management
2. **Provider Models Service** - Model discovery
3. **Model Mappings Service** - Routing configuration
4. **System Service** - System info and health
5. **Settings Service** - Configuration management
6. **Analytics Service** - Usage tracking
7. **Provider Health Service** - Health monitoring

### ❌ Missing Services (Optional)
8. **Security Service** - IP filtering, security events
9. **Configuration Service** - Advanced routing/caching
10. **Monitoring Service** - Real-time monitoring

## Impact Analysis

### Critical Impact (Blocking Features)
- **Provider Management**: Cannot add, edit, or remove providers
- **Model Discovery**: Cannot see available models
- **Model Routing**: Cannot configure model mappings
- **Authentication**: Login uses workaround due to missing `system.getWebUIVirtualKey()`

### High Impact (Degraded Features)
- **Analytics**: All analytics endpoints return mock data
- **Health Monitoring**: Provider health checks use mock data
- **Settings**: Configuration management is limited

### WebUI Workarounds
- 44 API routes use mock data or hardcoded responses
- Type augmentation file masks TypeScript errors
- Many features show loading states indefinitely

## Effort Estimate

### Phase 1: Critical Services (2-3 weeks)
- Implement 4 critical services
- Update OpenAPI schema
- Generate TypeScript types
- Write unit tests

### Phase 2: Important Services (1-2 weeks)
- Implement 3 important services
- Integration testing
- Documentation

### Phase 3: Optional Services (1 week)
- Implement remaining services
- Performance optimization
- Final testing

**Total Estimate**: 4-6 weeks for complete SDK

## Quick Win Alternative

### Minimal SDK Completion (1 week)
Instead of implementing all services, create a minimal viable SDK:

1. **Add only critical methods**:
   ```typescript
   providers: {
     list(): Promise<any>;
     create(data: any): Promise<any>;
     update(id: number, data: any): Promise<any>;
   }
   
   system: {
     getWebUIVirtualKey(): Promise<string>;
     getSystemInfo(): Promise<any>;
   }
   ```

2. **Use `any` types temporarily**
   - Remove type safety requirements
   - Focus on functionality
   - Add types later

3. **Benefits**:
   - WebUI becomes functional quickly
   - Remove type augmentation file
   - Iterate on types later

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Full Implementation (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Type safety, maintainability, best practices
- **Cons**: 4-6 weeks effort
- **When**: If long-term maintenance is priority

### Option 2: Minimal Implementation
- **Pros**: Quick delivery (1 week)
- **Cons**: Technical debt, no type safety
- **When**: If immediate functionality is priority

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Week 1: Minimal implementation for critical services
2. Week 2-3: Add type safety incrementally
3. Week 4+: Complete remaining services

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Review and approve SDK implementation approach
2. Update OpenAPI schema with missing endpoints
3. Set up SDK development environment

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Implement Phase 1 critical services
2. Remove type augmentation file
3. Test WebUI with updated SDK

### Long Term (Month)
1. Complete all SDK services
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation

## Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Type Generation**
   - Use OpenAPI schema generation?
   - Hand-write TypeScript interfaces?
   - Hybrid approach?

2. **Error Handling**
   - Extend existing ConduitError types?
   - Create service-specific errors?

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Breaking changes acceptable?
   - Version SDK separately?

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests only?
   - Integration tests against real API?
   - Mock server for testing?

## Conclusion

The SDK is currently incomplete and blocks critical WebUI functionality. The recommended approach is a hybrid implementation that delivers minimal functionality quickly while building towards a complete, type-safe SDK over 4-6 weeks.
