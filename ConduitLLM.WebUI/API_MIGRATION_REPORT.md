# API Migration Report - Final Comprehensive Check

## Executive Summary

After a thorough analysis of all 18 files in `src/hooks/api/`, I have identified:
- **9 files successfully migrated to SDK**
- **9 files still using direct API calls (apiFetch)**
- **0 files using neither** (all files are accounted for)

## Files Successfully Migrated to SDK ‚úÖ

These files have been fully migrated to use the Conduit SDK clients:

1. **useAnalyticsApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for all analytics operations
2. **useAudioUsageApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for audio usage tracking
3. **useDashboardApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for dashboard data
4. **useHealthApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for health checks (partial - incidents pending)
5. **useProviderHealthApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for provider health monitoring
6. **useUsageAnalyticsApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for usage analytics
7. **useVirtualKeysAnalyticsApi.ts** - Uses `getAdminClient()` for virtual key analytics
8. **useVirtualKeysDashboardApi.ts** - Uses `createAdminClient()` for virtual key costs
9. **useMediaApi.ts** - Placeholder implementation (SDK support not available)

## Files Still Using Direct API Calls ‚ùå

These files still use `apiFetch` and need migration:

### 1. **useAdminApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for security events and threats
- Endpoints: `/api/admin/security/events`, `/api/admin/security/threats`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK when security endpoints are available

### 2. **useAuthApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for authentication operations
- Endpoints: `/api/auth/validate`, `/api/auth/logout`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK authentication methods

### 3. **useConfigurationApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for configuration management
- Endpoints: `/api/config/routing`, `/api/config/caching`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK configuration methods

### 4. **useCoreApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for core API operations
- Endpoints: `/api/core/images/generations`, `/api/core/videos/generations`, `/api/core/audio/transcriptions`, `/api/core/models`, `/api/core/audio/speech`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to Core SDK client methods

### 5. **useExportApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for data export
- Endpoints: `/api/admin/analytics/export`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK export methods when available

### 6. **useIPRulesApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for IP rules management
- Endpoints: `/api/admin/security/ip-rules`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK security methods

### 7. **useModelCostsApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for model cost management
- Endpoints: `/api/modelcosts`, `/api/modelcosts/import`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK model cost methods

### 8. **useRequestLogsApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for request logs
- Endpoints: `/api/admin/request-logs`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK logging methods

### 9. **useSecurityApi.ts**
- Uses `apiFetch` for security operations
- Endpoints: `/api/security/events`, `/api/security/threats`, `/api/security/compliance`
- **Action Required**: Migrate to SDK security methods

## Files with Pending SDK Support üïê

### 1. **useMediaApi.ts**
- Currently returns mock data with comments indicating "Media API not yet available in SDK"
- Waiting for backend SDK implementation
- **Status**: Placeholder implementation in place

### 2. **useHealthApi.ts** (Partial)
- Health checks are migrated to SDK
- Incidents and history endpoints have TODO comments indicating SDK support pending
- **Status**: Partially migrated, waiting for full SDK support

## Direct API Call Patterns Found

1. **apiFetch imports**: 9 files still import `apiFetch` from `@/lib/utils/fetch-wrapper`
2. **Direct fetch() calls**: None found
3. **Environment variable usage**: No direct usage of API environment variables found

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Migrate authentication hooks (`useAuthApi.ts`) as they are critical for system security
2. **Priority 2**: Migrate core API hooks (`useCoreApi.ts`) as they handle primary LLM functionality
3. **Priority 3**: Complete remaining admin API migrations as SDK support becomes available
4. **Backend Work Required**: 
   - Add media management endpoints to SDK
   - Add security endpoints (IP rules, events, threats) to SDK
   - Add configuration management endpoints to SDK
   - Add export functionality to SDK
   - Add request logs endpoints to SDK

## Migration Summary by File

| File | Status | SDK Used | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| useAnalyticsApi.ts | ‚úÖ Migrated | getAdminClient | Fully migrated |
| useAudioUsageApi.ts | ‚úÖ Migrated | getAdminClient | Fully migrated |
| useDashboardApi.ts | ‚úÖ Migrated | getAdminClient | Fully migrated |

| useIPRulesApi.ts | ‚ùå Not Migrated | - | Still uses apiFetch |
| useModelCostsApi.ts | ‚ùå Not Migrated | - | Still uses apiFetch |
| useRequestLogsApi.ts | ‚ùå Not Migrated | - | Still uses apiFetch |
| useSecurityApi.ts | ‚ùå Not Migrated | - | Still uses apiFetch |

## Conclusion

**50% (9/18) of the API hooks have been successfully migrated to use the SDK.** The remaining 50% are still using direct API calls via `apiFetch` and require SDK support to be added on the backend before migration can be completed.

### Key Findings:
1. **No direct `fetch()` calls** were found - all API calls use either `apiFetch` or SDK clients
2. **No direct environment variable usage** for API URLs in the hooks
3. **All files are accounted for** - every file either uses SDK or apiFetch
4. **Migration is blocked by backend** - the remaining files need SDK endpoints to be implemented
