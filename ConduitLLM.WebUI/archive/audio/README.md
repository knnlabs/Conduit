# Audio Features Archive

## Overview
This folder contains audio-related functionality that has been temporarily archived to hide incomplete features from the production UI. These features are planned for future development but are not currently functional.

## Archived Date
2025-01-16

## Reason for Archiving
- Audio functionality is not feature complete
- Features contain placeholder/mock implementations
- Business logic should be preserved for future development
- Need to remove from navigation and compilation to avoid user confusion

## Archived Files

### Pages (from src/app/)
- `pages/audio-processing/` - Audio processing configuration and job monitoring
- `pages/audio-providers/` - Audio providers configuration (includes .backup file)
- `pages/audio-usage/` - Audio usage analytics and reporting

### API Routes (from src/app/api/)
- `api/audio/speech/` - Text-to-speech API endpoint
- `api/audio/transcribe/` - Speech-to-text/transcription API endpoint
- `api/audio-configuration/` - Audio configuration management
  - `api/audio-configuration/[providerId]/` - Individual provider configuration
  - `api/audio-configuration/[providerId]/test/` - Provider connection testing
  - `api/audio-configuration/usage/` - Audio usage data API
  - `api/audio-configuration/usage/summary/` - Audio usage summary API

### Components (from src/app/chat/components/)
- `components/AudioInput.tsx` - Audio input component (stub implementation with TODOs)

### Navigation Items Removed
From `src/lib/navigation/items.ts`:
1. Audio Processing (`/audio-processing`) - Operations section
2. Audio Providers (`/audio-providers`) - Configuration section  
3. Audio Usage (`/audio-usage`) - Keys & Analytics section

### Import Cleanup
- Removed unused `IconMicrophone` import from navigation items

## Current State
- All API routes return "not available" (HTTP 501) responses
- Pages contain mock data and placeholder functionality
- AudioInput component is a stub with extensive TODO comments
- No functional audio processing capabilities

## Future Restoration
To restore audio functionality:
1. Move files back to their original locations in `src/`
2. Restore navigation items in `src/lib/navigation/items.ts`
3. Add back `IconMicrophone` import if needed
4. Implement actual audio processing logic
5. Update API routes to provide real functionality
6. Complete AudioInput component implementation
7. Test all audio features before releasing

## Dependencies
Audio features may require additional dependencies when implemented:
- Audio processing libraries
- Speech-to-text services
- Text-to-speech services
- Audio file handling utilities

## Notes
- This archive preserves all business logic and UI components
- No functionality was lost - only moved out of compilation
- Code can be easily restored when development resumes
- TypeScript/Next.js will ignore these files in the archive folder
