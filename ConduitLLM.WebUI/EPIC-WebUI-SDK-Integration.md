# Epic: WebUI SDK Feature Integration

## Overview
This epic tracks the integration of new SDK features into the WebUI once they are implemented in the Conduit SDKs. This is a follow-up epic that depends on the completion of the SDK Feature Parity epic.

## Background
The WebUI has been migrated to use SDK clients, but many features are currently implemented as stubs due to missing SDK support. Once the SDK features are implemented, the WebUI needs to be updated to use these new capabilities.

## Scope
Replace all stub implementations in the WebUI with actual SDK functionality and enhance the user experience with the newly available real-time features.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of relevant user stories from the SDK Feature Parity epic
- Updated SDK packages published to npm
