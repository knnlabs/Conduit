# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains the CI/CD workflows for the Conduit project.

## Active Workflows

### ðŸ”¨ Build and Release (`build-and-release.yml`)
The main CI/CD workflow that handles building, testing, and releasing Docker images.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `master` or `dev` branches
- Pull requests to `master` or `dev` branches
- Release events

**Features:**
- âœ… .NET package caching for faster builds
- âœ… Matrix strategy for parallel Docker builds
- âœ… Multi-platform Docker images (amd64, arm64)
- âœ… CodeQL security scanning with quality gates
- âœ… Test result reporting with coverage
- âœ… Concurrency controls to prevent race conditions
- âœ… Comprehensive job summaries

**Jobs:**
1. **CodeQL Analysis** - Security scanning with high severity checks
2. **Build and Test** - .NET build with test reporting
3. **Docker Build** - Parallel multi-platform image builds
4. **Summary** - Final build status report

### ðŸ”’ CodeQL Scheduled Scan (`codeql-analysis.yml`)
Weekly security scanning for vulnerabilities.

**Triggers:**
- Weekly schedule (Sundays at midnight)
- Manual workflow dispatch with branch selection

**Features:**
- âœ… Multi-language support (C#, JavaScript)
- âœ… Customizable query filters
- âœ… SARIF result archiving
- âœ… Security issue summaries by severity
- âœ… Branch selection for manual runs

### ðŸ“š Documentation (`documentation.yml`)
Deploys Docusaurus documentation to GitHub Pages.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `master` (website changes)
- Pull requests to `master` (website changes)

**Features:**
- âœ… Artifact-based deployment (no duplicate builds)
- âœ… PR preview deployments via Netlify
- âœ… Build statistics and summaries
- âœ… Automatic PR comments with preview URLs
- âœ… GitHub Pages environment tracking

### ðŸ“¦ NPM Publishing (`npm-publish-admin-client.yml`, `npm-publish-core-client.yml`)
Publishes Node.js client packages to NPM.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `dev` or `master` (client code changes)
- Manual workflow dispatch with version control

**Features:**
- âœ… Automated version management with timestamps
- âœ… NPM provenance attestation
- âœ… Dry run mode for testing
- âœ… Package quality checks
- âœ… GitHub release creation with changelogs
- âœ… Failure notifications via GitHub issues
- âœ… Concurrency controls for version bumps

### ðŸš€ Release Orchestration (`release-orchestration.yml`)
Unified release workflow for coordinating all components.

**Triggers:**
- Manual workflow dispatch only

**Features:**
- âœ… Coordinated multi-component releases
- âœ… Selective component releasing
- âœ… Automated version calculation
- âœ… Comprehensive release notes generation
- âœ… Dry run mode for validation
- âœ… Sequential NPM â†’ Docker release order

## Deprecated Workflows

Deprecated workflows have been moved to `.github/workflows/deprecated/`:
- `publish-docker.yml` - Replaced by Docker publishing in `build-and-release.yml`
- `docker-release.yml` - Replaced by Docker publishing in `build-and-release.yml`
- `codeql-local.yml` - Replaced by CodeQL integration in `build-and-release.yml`

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Security First**: CodeQL scanning blocks deployments on high severity issues
2. **Caching**: Extensive caching for dependencies and Docker layers
3. **Concurrency**: Prevents race conditions in version bumps and deployments
4. **Parallelization**: Matrix strategies for faster builds
5. **Visibility**: Comprehensive job summaries and status reporting
6. **Reliability**: Failure notifications and retry mechanisms
7. **Flexibility**: Dry run modes and manual triggers for testing

## Required Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `NPM_TOKEN`: Required for NPM publishing
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Optional, for documentation previews
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Optional, for documentation previews

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Weekly Tasks**:
   - Review CodeQL scan results
   - Check for workflow failures

2. **Monthly Tasks**:
   - Update action versions
   - Review and optimize caching strategies
   - Clean up old workflow runs

3. **Quarterly Tasks**:
   - Audit workflow permissions
   - Review deprecation notices
   - Optimize build times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NPM Publish Failures**
   - Check NPM_TOKEN is valid
   - Verify package.json has all required fields
   - Ensure no version conflicts

2. **Docker Build Failures**
   - Check Docker Hub rate limits
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax
   - Ensure base images are available

3. **Concurrent Version Bumps**
   - Workflows use concurrency groups to prevent this
   - If issues persist, check git history for conflicts

### Getting Help

- Create an issue in the repository
- Check GitHub Actions documentation
- Review workflow run logs for detailed errors
