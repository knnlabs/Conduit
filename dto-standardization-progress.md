# DTO Standardization Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. Fixed the WebUI project (builds with only warnings)
   - Added compatibility properties to DTOs
   - Created extension methods for DTO conversions
   - Updated interface implementations to match new return types
   - Fixed CostDashboardServiceAdapter and VirtualKeyServiceAdapter

2. Fixed the Admin project (builds with only warnings)
   - Added extension methods for services
   - Created DatabaseExtensions for IConfigurationDbContext
   - Added appropriate using directives and namespace aliases
   - Fixed repository interfaces and implementations

3. Fixed the Admin.Tests project (builds with warnings)
   - Created test wrapper classes for MasterKeyAuthorizationHandler
   - Fixed expression tree issues in tests (using It.IsAny instead of default)
   - Fixed VirtualKey and VirtualKeyDto property references

4. Created compatibility helpers in the Tests project
   - Added LogsSummaryDtoExtensions for backward compatibility
   - Created CostDashboardDtoExtensions for model/trend data
   - Added VirtualKeyCostDataDtoExtensions for conversion
   - Added VirtualKeyExtensions for entity compatibility

## Remaining Tasks

1. Fix the remaining errors in the Tests project:
   - Resolve ambiguous references to DTOs (VirtualKeyDto, LogsSummaryDto, etc.)
   - Fix method signature mismatches (like IpFilterServiceAdapter.UpdateFilterAsync)
   - Resolve type conversion issues (CostTrendDataDto.Requests method group)
   - Update extension method usage in RequestLogServiceTests

2. General Improvements:
   - Add 'new' keyword to properties that hide inherited members
   - Add full XML documentation to new compatibility properties
   - Consider consolidating duplicate DTOs with inheritance
   - Update usages of deprecated properties across the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Continue fixing the Tests project errors systematically:
   - Focus on fixing one test class at a time
   - Prioritize the most used/referenced DTO types
   - Create extension methods for complex conversions
   - Use fully qualified type names to resolve ambiguities

2. After all build errors are fixed:
   - Run tests to identify runtime issues
   - Document the DTO standardization approach
   - Create guidelines for future DTO additions
