# Node.js SDK Security, Performance, and Reliability Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the findings from a comprehensive security, performance, and reliability audit of the Conduit Node.js SDKs (Core and Admin clients). The audit identified several critical and high-severity issues that need immediate attention before production deployment on a public website.

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. **API Key Exposure in Client-Side Code** [CRITICAL]
**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: Core and Admin client implementations  
**Description**: Both SDKs transmit API keys directly in HTTP headers without any obfuscation or secure transmission mechanism.

**Evidence**:
- `BaseClient.ts:39`: `[HTTP_HEADERS.AUTHORIZATION]: 'Bearer ${this.config.apiKey}'`
- `BaseApiClient.ts:23`: `[HTTP_HEADERS.X_API_KEY]: config.masterKey`
- `BaseSignalRConnection.ts:88`: `accessTokenFactory: () => this.virtualKey`

**Risk**: API keys embedded in client-side JavaScript are visible to anyone inspecting the source code, leading to unauthorized access and potential abuse.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement a backend proxy pattern where the frontend communicates with your backend, which then makes authenticated calls to Conduit
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Consider implementing short-lived tokens with refresh mechanisms

### 2. **SignalR WebSocket Authentication Vulnerability** [CRITICAL]
**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: `BaseSignalRConnection.ts`  
**Description**: SignalR connections pass the virtual key directly in the `accessTokenFactory`, exposing it in WebSocket frames.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
accessTokenFactory: () => this.virtualKey, // Line 88
```

**Risk**: WebSocket frames can be inspected in browser dev tools, exposing API keys.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement a token exchange mechanism where the API key is exchanged for a short-lived WebSocket token
- Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) exclusively
- Implement connection-level authentication

## High-Severity Issues

### 3. **No Request Signing or HMAC Validation** [HIGH]
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Requests are not signed, making them vulnerable to tampering and replay attacks.

**Risk**: Attackers can intercept and modify requests, potentially escalating privileges or manipulating data.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement request signing using HMAC-SHA256
- Include timestamps to prevent replay attacks
- Validate signatures server-side

### 4. **Insufficient Input Validation** [HIGH]
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `validation.ts`  
**Description**: Input validation is minimal and doesn't protect against injection attacks.

**Evidence**:
- No sanitization of prompt inputs that could contain malicious content
- No validation of URLs in model configurations
- No protection against prototype pollution in JSON parsing

**Recommendation**:
- Implement comprehensive input sanitization
- Use a validation library like `joi` or `yup` for robust validation
- Sanitize all user inputs before sending to the API

### 5. **Vulnerable Dependencies** [HIGH]
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `package.json`  
**Description**: Using axios 1.6.2 which has known vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-45857).

**Recommendation**:
- Update axios to the latest version (1.7.7+)
- Implement regular dependency auditing with `npm audit`
- Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot for continuous monitoring

### 6. **Memory Leak Potential in SignalR Connections** [HIGH]
**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `SignalRService.ts`  
**Description**: SignalR connections are stored in a Map but may not be properly cleaned up.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
private readonly connections = new Map<string, BaseSignalRConnection>();
```

**Risk**: Long-running applications could accumulate orphaned connections, leading to memory exhaustion.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement connection lifecycle management
- Add automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Monitor connection count and implement limits

---

## Medium-Severity Issues

### 7. **Excessive Error Information Exposure** [MEDIUM]
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `errors.ts`  
**Description**: Error messages include detailed endpoint and method information that could aid attackers.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
const enhancedMessage = `${baseMessage}${endpointInfo}`; // Line 152
```

**Recommendation**:
- Implement different error verbosity levels for development vs production
- Log detailed errors server-side but return generic messages to clients
- Never expose internal system paths or configurations

### 8. **No Rate Limiting Implementation** [MEDIUM]
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: While the SDK handles rate limit errors, it doesn't implement client-side rate limiting.

**Risk**: Applications could inadvertently trigger rate limits, causing service disruption.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement client-side rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- Add request queuing with backpressure
- Provide rate limit status to applications

### 9. **Inefficient Retry Logic** [MEDIUM]
**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `BaseClient.ts`  
**Description**: Retry logic uses exponential backoff but doesn't implement jitter.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
return delay + Math.random() * 1000; // Line 142 - Only 1 second jitter
```

**Recommendation**:
- Implement full jitter algorithm to prevent thundering herd
- Make retry configuration more granular per operation type
- Add circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints

### 10. **No Connection Pooling for HTTP Requests** [MEDIUM]
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Each client instance creates its own axios instance without connection pooling.

**Risk**: High-volume applications will create excessive connections, leading to performance degradation.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement HTTP agent with keep-alive and connection pooling
- Configure appropriate pool sizes based on expected load
- Monitor connection metrics

---

## Low-Severity Issues

### 11. **Incomplete TypeScript Type Safety** [LOW]
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: Several places use `any` type, reducing type safety benefits.

**Evidence**:
- `BaseSignalRConnection.ts:214`: `...args: any[]`
- `BaseApiClient.ts:146`: `const errorData = data as any`

**Recommendation**:
- Replace `any` with proper types or `unknown`
- Enable strict TypeScript configuration
- Use type guards for runtime validation

### 12. **Console Logging in Production** [LOW]
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: SDK uses console.log/debug which can expose sensitive information.

**Evidence**: Multiple instances of `console.log`, `console.debug`, `console.error`

**Recommendation**:
- Implement a proper logging abstraction
- Allow applications to provide their own logger
- Ensure no sensitive data is logged

### 13. **Missing Content Security Policy Headers** [LOW]
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: SDK doesn't set or validate CSP headers for responses.

**Recommendation**:
- Add CSP header validation
- Provide guidance on CSP configuration for applications using the SDK

### 14. **No Telemetry or Monitoring Hooks** [LOW]
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: SDK doesn't provide hooks for application monitoring or telemetry.

**Recommendation**:
- Add instrumentation points for key operations
- Support OpenTelemetry or similar standards
- Allow metric collection for performance monitoring

## Performance Recommendations

1. **Implement Request Batching**: For high-volume scenarios, batch multiple requests to reduce overhead
2. **Add Response Caching**: Implement intelligent caching for read operations
3. **Optimize Bundle Size**: Current bundle includes all services even if not used
4. **Implement Progressive Loading**: Load SignalR and other heavy dependencies only when needed
5. **Add Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate concurrent requests for the same resource

---

## Security Best Practices for Implementation

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files with real keys
2. **Key Rotation**: Implement support for key rotation without downtime
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all API operations for security auditing
4. **IP Whitelisting**: Support IP-based access restrictions
5. **CORS Configuration**: Provide clear guidance on CORS setup

---

## Immediate Action Items

1. **DO NOT use these SDKs directly in browser/frontend code**
2. **Update all dependencies** to latest secure versions
3. **Implement backend proxy pattern** for API communication
4. **Add comprehensive input validation** and sanitization
5. **Review and update all example code** to demonstrate secure patterns

---

## Conclusion

While the Conduit Node.js SDKs provide good functionality and developer experience, they have critical security vulnerabilities that make them unsuitable for direct use in production web applications. The primary issue is the exposure of API keys in client-side code, which is a fundamental security flaw.

The recommended approach is to use these SDKs only in backend Node.js applications (server-side) and implement a secure proxy pattern for frontend communication. With the recommended security enhancements, the SDKs can be made production-ready for high-volume public websites.
