# Conduit DotNet Client SDKs (ARCHIVED)

> **Status: Archived** – These .NET Client SDK projects were moved to `archive/Clients.DotNet` on 2025-07-10 and are not maintained at the moment. They remain here for historical reference and can be re-enabled by moving them back, re-adding the projects to solution files, and updating build/CI scripts.

The SDKs include:

- `ConduitLLM.CoreClient` – .NET client for the Core API
- `ConduitLLM.AdminClient` – .NET client for the Admin API

These SDKs were fully functional at the time of archival but may drift from the live APIs over time.
