# Node.js SDK Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes made to the ConduitLLM Node.js SDK to address non-existent API endpoints and add missing functionality, mirroring the fixes applied to the .NET SDK.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Video Generation - Non-existent Synchronous Endpoint
**Problem**: The SDK defined a synchronous video generation endpoint at `/v1/videos/generations` which doesn't exist in the Core API.

**Solution**:
- Removed the synchronous `generate()` method from `VideosService.ts`
- Removed the non-existent `GENERATIONS_ENDPOINT` constant
- Added deprecation comment explaining that only async generation is supported
- Updated the task status endpoint to use the correct path with `/tasks/`

**Files Modified**:
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/services/VideosService.ts`
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/constants/endpoints.ts`

### 2. ❌ Image Edit/Variations - Not Fixed
**Status**: These endpoints (`/v1/images/edits` and `/v1/images/variations`) are defined in the SDK but not implemented in the Core API.

**Action Taken**: Added comments in the endpoints file noting that these endpoints are not implemented.

**Files Modified**:
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/constants/endpoints.ts`

### 3. ✅ Health Endpoints - Fixed Wrong Paths
**Problem**: The SDK was using wrong health endpoint paths (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`) and trying to use authenticated endpoints when the health endpoint is at root level without authentication.

**Solution**:
- Updated `HealthService.ts` to use the correct `/health` endpoint (root level, no `/v1` prefix)
- Modified all health check methods to use a separate axios instance without authentication headers
- Added comments explaining that health checks don't require authentication

**Files Modified**:
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/services/HealthService.ts`

### 4. ✅ Batch Operations - Updated Documentation
**Problem**: The SDK defined a generic `/v1/batch` endpoint that doesn't exist. The Core API uses specific batch endpoints.

**Solution**:
- Updated `endpoints.ts` to document the specific batch endpoints
- Added constants for `spend-updates`, `virtual-key-updates`, and `webhook-sends` endpoints
- The `BatchOperationsService.ts` was already using the correct specific endpoints

**Files Modified**:
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/constants/endpoints.ts`

### 5. ✅ Missing Embeddings Support - Added
**Problem**: The Core API has a `/v1/embeddings` endpoint but it was missing from the SDK.

**Solution**:
- Created `embeddings.ts` with TypeScript interfaces and types for request/response models
- Created `EmbeddingsService.ts` with full embeddings functionality including:
  - Single and batch embedding creation
  - Similarity search functionality
  - Text grouping by similarity
  - Helper functions for vector operations
- Added embeddings endpoint constant to `endpoints.ts`
- Added `embeddings` property to `ConduitCoreClient.ts`
- Exported all embeddings types and services in `index.ts`

**New Files Created**:
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/models/embeddings.ts`
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/services/EmbeddingsService.ts`

**Files Modified**:
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/constants/endpoints.ts`
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/client/ConduitCoreClient.ts`
- `/SDKs/Node/Core/src/index.ts`

## Additional Features Added

### Embeddings Service Features
- Create embeddings for single or multiple texts
- Support for different models (text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large)
- Cosine similarity calculation
- Find most similar texts from a list of candidates
- Group texts by similarity threshold
- Support for both float and base64 encoding formats
- Dimension reduction support for text-embedding-3 models
- Helper functions for vector operations (normalize, euclidean distance, centroid)

### Usage Examples Added
The Node.js SDK now includes comprehensive JSDoc examples for all embeddings methods, making it easy for developers to understand and use the functionality.

## Key Differences from .NET SDK

1. **TypeScript-First Design**: The Node.js SDK uses TypeScript interfaces and type safety throughout
2. **Axios-Based HTTP Client**: Uses axios for HTTP requests instead of HttpClient
3. **Promise-Based API**: All methods return Promises for async operations
4. **Server-Optimized**: Designed for Node.js server environments with proper error handling
5. **Comprehensive Examples**: JSDoc includes detailed usage examples for each method

## Build Status
The Node.js SDK should build successfully with these changes. Run:
```bash
cd SDKs/Node/Core
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test video generation to ensure it works with the async-only approach
2. Test embeddings functionality with different models
3. Verify health checks work correctly without authentication
4. Test batch operations with the documented endpoints
5. Ensure TypeScript types are correctly exported and usable

## Remaining Issues
1. **Image Edit/Variations**: The SDK still references these non-existent endpoints. They should either be implemented in the Core API or removed from the SDK.
2. **Missing Endpoints**: The SDK is still missing support for several Core API endpoints:
   - `/v1/discovery/*` - Model discovery endpoints (partially implemented)
   - `/v1/media/*` - Media management endpoints
   - `/v1/realtime` - Real-time endpoints (partially implemented via SignalR)
