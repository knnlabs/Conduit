# ConduitLLM.Admin.Tests

This project contains unit tests for the ConduitLLM.Admin API project. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the Admin API controllers and services.

## ✅ Current Status

The Admin API tests are now fully functional with all dependency issues resolved:

- ✅ **Clean Build**: All tests build successfully with standardized DTO references
- ✅ **No Dependency Issues**: Clean architecture with proper project separation  
- ✅ **All DTOs Standardized**: Using centralized ConduitLLM.Configuration.DTOs namespace

## Test Structure

The tests are organized to match the structure of the Admin API project:

- **Controllers/** - Tests for API controllers
- **Services/** - Tests for service implementations
- **Security/** - Tests for authorization and security components

## Test Coverage

When the dependency issues are resolved, these tests will provide coverage for:

### Controllers
- VirtualKeysController
- IpFilterController
- SystemInfoController
- CostDashboardController
- LogsController
- ModelProviderMappingController
- RouterController

### Services
- AdminVirtualKeyService
- AdminIpFilterService
- AdminLogService
- AdminCostDashboardService
- AdminModelProviderMappingService
- AdminRouterService

### Security
- MasterKeyAuthorizationHandler

## ✅ Completed Improvements

All previous dependency issues have been successfully resolved:

1. ✅ **Standardized DTO References**: All DTOs now use centralized ConduitLLM.Configuration.DTOs namespace with domain-specific organization

2. ✅ **Clean Service Implementation**: Services now properly use repository interfaces without any WebUI dependencies and align with standardized entity models

3. ✅ **Production Ready**: Both unit tests and integration testing capabilities are fully functional

## Test Design Approach

The tests in this project follow these principles:

1. **Isolation** - Using mocks to isolate the system under test
2. **Comprehensive coverage** - Testing success paths, error paths, and edge cases
3. **Readability** - Using descriptive test names following the pattern: `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult`
4. **Maintainability** - Focused tests with minimal setup that verify specific behaviors

## Running Tests

Once the dependency issues are resolved, tests can be run with:

```bash
dotnet test ConduitLLM.Admin.Tests
```

For specific test classes:

```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName=ConduitLLM.Admin.Tests.Controllers.VirtualKeysControllerTests"
```

## Code Coverage

To generate code coverage reports, run:

```bash
dotnet test ConduitLLM.Admin.Tests /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=cobertura
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a test class named after the component being tested (e.g., `ComponentNameTests.cs`)
2. Use the existing test structure as a template
3. Include tests for all public methods
4. Cover success cases, failure cases, and edge cases (null inputs, empty collections, etc.)
5. Verify both return values and side effects (e.g., repository method calls)
